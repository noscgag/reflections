You must use git add to add a new file to the repo.

You must also use git add to put a modified file into the staging area. If you don't, git commit won't commit the changes for that file.

To see which files are in the staging area use git diff --staged.

To discard all uncommitted modifications use git reset --hard.

use git branch <branchname> to create a branch, then git checkout <branchname> to switch to it.

Both can be done at once with git checkout -b <branchname>

Use git log --graph --oneline to see graphical representation of commits and branches
